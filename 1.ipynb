      "This is every car lover's worst nightmare. Your brand new car burning to the ground in front of your eyes. But what makes it even worse is that this isn't just any car. It's a Porsche 918 Spider. This was the most powerful, most expensive, and fastest Porsche ever made. It's part of the Heimer car holy trinity along with a Ferrari LaFerrari and McLaren P1, a trio of million-doll cars that rewrote the rule book on speed nearly a decade ago. But despite the 918 Spider having the least power and most weight of the three cars on paper, it could go from 0 to 60 mph in 2.2 2 seconds, nearly half a second faster than the other two cars, thanks to its nearly 900 horsepower hybrid electric drivetrain and all-wheel drive. It's also the only one out of the three to post a Nurburgring lap time. And when it did, it set the world record for fastest street legal production car around the track. So, this car was a really big deal. And with prices soaring to nearly $4 million for pristine examples, the only way I'd ever be able to afford a 918 Spider of my own is to find one that needs a little bit of work. Exotic car fans avert your eyes. A rare and very expensive Porsche 918 hybrid went up in flames at a gas station last night in Kaledan, Ontario. Gas ignited while the car was being filled. Car was worth over a million dollars. I managed to track down this car in Canada, and even before seeing it, I knew it was a worstc case scenario. Now, I'll be the first to tell you that rebuilding a car that burnt completely down at a fuel station is a challenge, but rebuilding a hybrid hypercar that now costs around $2 million to buy after it sat for a decade is an order of magnitude more difficult. So, I immediately went on AutoTest to research what I'd be getting into. So, AutoTempest allows me or you to search nationwide across every major car listing site in one easy search. But you probably already knew that they have just added something new, though. I can now use their new price trend search to see that over the last several years, the Porsche 918 Spider market has absolutely exploded. But it doesn't just work on hypercars. You can search any make and model and filter by anything you want. transmission, body style, trim, and you can see right away what direction prices are headed and when is the best time to buy your next car. AutoTempest has been a wonderful supporter of my channel and projects over the years. So, go try it out right now. It's totally free and it's an absolute gamecher if you're trying to buy your next daily driver or just window shopping for your dream car. You can check it out in the link in the video description below. And with the knowledge that this was the cheapest 918 Spider that I could find anywhere, I talked to the seller and hopped on the next flight to Toronto to see it for the first time. All right, it is super cold. Uh I think it's like -16 or 18° C. Don't know what that translates to in Fahrenheit. It is colder than uh I have ever been. Well, I've been in a long time. But I'm super excited because in that building, I can't believe I'm saying this, is a very fired damaged Porsche 918 Spider. Let's go check it out. Now, this wasn't just any junkyard. I was at First Choice Auto Salvage, a family-run business that had been operating for over 40 years with a wide range of cars from daily drivers that needed a bit of work to rare sports cars that needed new owners. And what I really liked is that they were incredibly upfront and didn't hide any damage on their cars, so you knew what you were getting with cars that were way below retail prices. Now, I will admit, dealing with these guys was an absolute dream, but I was there to see a fire damaged Porsche hypercar, and nothing could have prepared me for what I actually saw. Oh no. Oh my goodness. So, here's what happened to this car. When the last owner was filling up at a fuel station, he for some reason or another mistakenly got fuel on the hot exhaust pipes, and the rest was history. Fortunately, the fire was put out before anyone was hurt. But unfortunately, most of the 7 figure hypercar was burned beyond recognition. It then sat for more than 10 years while investigators, insurance companies, and Porsche tried to find out what exactly happened. And because I'm the exact right kind of idiot that would buy a car like this, I was first on the list of people to contact when it came time to sell. This is a monumental amount of damage. They don't tell you how much damage fire does until you actually see it. And it it is it is insane. It is insane. Like so this is the carbon tub. So the carbon tub is right here. Uh this is the uh it's called a monok. And then uh after this this is the subframe which is also made of carbon fiber. And that you know to in order for this to get compromised it needs to be something like a,000° C. Um but you can see the gel coat is completely worn away. I can like almost push through this with my finger.\n",
      " It's not exactly the best thing in the world. The wheel melted. You have the suspension here, the suspension uprights. Uh, they're no good. And back here, this is where the ECU and, uh, a lot of the hybrid system was, but it's not anymore. This is, look at all the wiring. Look at what happened to the wires. You can see the bare copper wires and the filaments for the carbon fiber. It just came apart because they're under compression. And then when the fire happened, they just went, \"Wow.\" So this is the back of the of the tub. And it's just there's nothing there. Oh my goodness. Like you could just push through everything. It's just soft. Everything is so soft. One of these went for $3.9 million. So, this is a naturally aspirated 4.6 L V8 and it's all the way in there. But I think since the fire was underneath the car as well as on top, then that V8 is probably not in great shape. Um, but the intakes are actually on the bottom of the engine and the exhaust is on the top. So, the exhaust comes in here and then it shoots out here. This is not usually supposed to open, but look at that. Yikes. Oh boy. Okay, so every single wire is melted. I see melted coil packs, which means that that engine probably doesn't turn because the uh metal inside has uh has had some damage. This is such a shame. It's It's so crazy. See if the door opens, though. Ooh. Hey, door opens. Even more carbon damage here. 500 kilometers. Says true mileage unknown, but we can we can hazard a guess. This is also a spider, meaning that these roof sections, they're supposed to come off. Not like that, but they're supposed to come off and go in the trunk. Dude, this this entire interior is just destroyed. Completely and utterly destroyed. The seats are very similar to the ones in my GT3. Um, but you can see they've uh seen better days. They could probably use um a reupholstering. I I think they might be able to be fixed just like this carbon might be able to be fixed if you like recarbon it. But another thing is that this is weirdly uh it's a base model. It's not the uh the ViceAC pack. ViceAs packs pack. And uh those tend to go for more money cuz they have like better arrow and better brakes and stuff, but it's still multi-million dollar car that this happened to. And it's a hybrid. So this is Well, not that's where the charging port is. So the charging port, I'm going to go ahead and say it probably doesn't work. So this is where the fire was concentrated. And if you look at this, like look, this is the door. It's it's like it's like a feather. Look at that. Like that's supposed to be super hard carbon. That's supposed to be super hard carbon. And honestly, I don't know how you fix this. If we were to fix this, it it would we would have to consult with like material experts to make sure everything's good. Um because pictures say one thing, but then you actually look at this and it's a completely different story. I mean, just take a look at that inter. It's so cool. It is so awesome. Have the big LCD screens uh in the middle and behind the gauge cluster. Has the uh little switch here for the hybrid and electric. And it just it looks so awesome from this angle. If you squinted your eyes and then backed up about 500 ft, it would be all right. Like, it would be okay. It'd be like an okay car. All right, so this is going to be my first time uh sitting in this 918. I can't get in the driver's seat cuz obvious reasons. Let's just pretend this is UK and this is right-hand drive. Oh man. Oh, dude. This is crazy, man. This is crazy. There's actually a decent amount of headroom. Like, it's comfortable in here. It It feels like the GT3 because it's the seat is uh essentially the same. I don't even want to touch the dust cuz this is 10 years of dust on here. The airbag is a little melty. Uh steering wheel is a little melty. Some of the gauges are a little past it, but maybe that's maybe that's rebuildable. This is so much work. This is so much work. The fire melted the steering wheel, some of the gauges.\n",
      " Oh, wow.\n",
      " Um but if if you look over here, like this this tiny little nub, that's the uh that's the gear stick. Look at it. I'm in love with this car. I I this is I love the spec. I love uh the look of this car and I love the story. I don't I don't love what's directly behind me, though. Also, cup holder. Look at this. You know, has a cup holder\n",
      " included.\n",
      " Yeah, it is a little bit of an afterthought, which is weird for Porsche. Um but cup holder is right here. So, in case you got drinks. So there's no real good way of getting out of this car. It's just kind of But what I like normal doors. It doesn't have the the the crazy dihedral whatevers. Still closes like a Porsche. I'm going to see if maybe this opens up. Dude, look at this. So I'm used to seeing a lot of sand and stuff in my hypercar. So, it's uh it's interesting that there's no sand here. Um what I think happened right here and right here is when the fire happened, firemen usually break apart the front of the car to get to what's known as a fireman's loop. And that pulls the the battery connection that pulls the power from the hybrid battery. And a lot of times they don't know where that is. I think they were looking for the fireman's loop. and sometimes they just destroy the front of the car. Um, but this car, you can see, look, this is all one piece of carbon fiber. This one giant piece of carbon fiber, just like all of this is, and it's just been destroyed. So, I happen to know a few prices for parts for this car. A rear subframe section is $96,000. That's just a subframe. That's not the monog. That's not anything attached to it. That's not any of the bracketry. That's not any of the hoses that attach to the engine. Just the subframe itself that the engine sits in $96,000. Uh each door is about $30,000 and that is completely bare. It's a door skin. The quarter panel is another $40,000 and we would need two of them. Uh the monok itself, if you can get it from Porsche, which you probably can't, it's about $250,000. That engine is another $250 grand. Each brake disc is about 10 grand. So you got $40,000 in brakes. What I've noticed is that we have the battery here. So the battery is out of the car thankfully and it hasn't exploded because uh you know the on the P1 that had that was big mad. That was really really exploded. But uh I I don't know if that works. It probably doesn't because you don't want to leave lithium batteries, you know, sitting for 10 years. So, one of those I don't quote me on this, but I believe it's $156,000. This also has a hybrid system that incorporates the front axle and the rear axle. So, there's two motors. Um, the the ones in the front I assume are okay because I mean it looks okay. The ones in the back probably not so okay. We can get this running now. Like, just get a jump jump box. I feel like I feel like we're good. How do you even load this thing on a trailer? Like realistically, how do you how do you do that? Because it's I I think it would fall it would literally fall apart if you tried to do that. Only one way to find out. Welcome to uh 3 and 1/2 months later. It's no longer snowing. It's no longer icy. And um this car is now mine. However, it's not going home right now because of one tiny issue. Canada and the US are now officially in a trade war. New substantial tariffs on both sides will be in place this Tuesday.\n",
      " There will be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons. They'll be uh putting the tariff of 25% on Canada. He has implemented the 25% blanket tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Those took effect this morning.\n",
      " And what this meant for me is that even though I paid a tiny fraction of what the car was originally worth, since I lived in the US and needed to get the car there, my new Porsche 918 Spider project suddenly got a lot more expensive. But knowing this, I had an idea and got the car on a flatbed as carefully as I could. Okay. All right. That was painful.\n",
      " I then wrapped it up so it wouldn't fall apart on the highway and delivered it to the other side of town where I had a workshop waiting for me. Now, this is still a huge gamble because this new tariff applies to every car coming into the states, but there is one notable exception. You see, if I bring the car over to the States as is, I get the full tariff. But if I bring it in as parts, I don't have to pay it. And honestly, if you look at it, it's a parts car. I mean, half of it is completely burnt anyway, but we have to prove that to the government. by taking the entire thing apart. I'm going to take the engine out of this. And to do it, I'm in a shop. I'm actually in the Vibrant Performance HQ. They lent me the shop for the weekend. It's a holiday here. Uh, and I have the entire weekend and maybe even Monday, uh, to take a Porsche 918 hypercar, $2 million car apart by myself. The first and only step when fully stripping a burnt out car is removing parts until the burnt ones are gone, which means I definitely won't have much left to work with. I sprayed some of the very small bolts with rust penetrint, then removed the 918's titanium heat shielding and settled in so I can really see the mess going on at the back. Oh my goodness. This is the business end of the hybrid system. I think this was the ECU, the engine computer, and everything is melted. So, this is it's all strands of carbon fiber. Look how they just come apart. It smells terrible, by the way. Why is it I always get cars that need wiring harnesses. There is a lot of good copper in here. I feel like if I sell that, it'll pay for maybe 2% of the cost of the car. Oh, some of these wires are still good. Added bonus. There we go. Cool. So, that's that's the back part of a 918. Pristine condition. There's some heat shielding. Feel like it didn't do its job. Now, I thought that maybe the carbon fiber structure uh was okayish, but now I'm looking at it. That's not great. And also uh you see where this attaches, this is the shock, it's not attached anymore. So I think the back end of this where the engine and transmission are mounted. I think this is pretty well compromised. Oh, that's good. If I peel away the layers like an onion, I might get a good car underneath. So, with any car project, it's important to make a note of where things go. But if things are this far gone, I think it's safe to say that no parts I'm removing will be reused. But I'm still keeping absolutely everything I can. Because if I've learned anything while working on cars, the second you throw a part away, that's when you need it the most. Taking off the removable roof on a normal car is pretty easy. Just one latch in the interior and it comes right out. But since mine aren't exactly pristine, they require a little more persuasion. On the passenger side, there's another coolant reservoir and the battery charging port, which actually seems in fairly decent shape considering it's made of plastic. The melted plastic shroud for the intake air filter is removed, and then the big red air filter itself. Now, this confetti looking thing is what's left of the strut mount. One of the strongest parts of the car, by the way. So, you can clearly tell how hot the fire got here. It also put ash and soot all over everything. So, I made sure to wear a mask and gloves and vacuumed as much junk as humanly possible so I didn't have to tell my pop I got to black lung. But even after this amount of cleanup, it was just the beginning of uncovering an absolutely monumental amount of damage on my 918 spider. All right, everyone. Welcome to episode number infinity of What Did I Get Myself into? This is the uh cleaned up engine bay of my Porsche 918 Spider, and it looks way worse than I thought, but also way better in some respects. So, this is the engine. 4.6 L naturally aspirated. Makes about 68 horsepower. I think this one doesn't make anything cuz I don't know if it runs. Probably doesn't. If you notice right here, the exhaust is actually on the top. It is a hot V engine, which means the intakes are on the bottom. They are a split system. So, four cylinders there, four cylinders here, and it's a carbon fiber intake system. Uh, you'll see that when we take the engine out, but if we go back here, right sandwiched in the middle of the two is the e- motor, sort of like it is on the P1. You can't really see it because there's a lot of melted plastic on top of it. And also, there's this duct that goes from the airbox into here, also melted. And back here is the Porsche PDK transmission, the dual clutch. And I believe that stands for dappel klang gribe. It's also toasty. Weird. Weird how everything burned in this car. But what's cool about this is you see that big hunk of plastic that has melted. That is actually the pan which means that the PDK transmission is turned upside down in this car which is very very odd. I don't think that is like an offtheshelf PDK transmission. I think that has different gear ratios or something. We'll figure that out. And we'll also figure out if that transmission works at some point, not today, because we got we got a lot to do. But one bit of good news is the interior. Now, it is singed, and this may need some carbon fiber repair work, but honestly, the interior looks relatively unscathed. I bet you if I just replaced the harness all the way to the back of the car and I just put the key in, I bet everything here would work. I should probably replace that airbag, too. That's a little little melty. But, um, everything here looks fantastic. And this car only had about 500 km, which is 300 mi, which is, fun fact, the same as my P1. So, if I have a 300 mile laferrari that went into a field or something, I'll have water type, fire type, and leaf type, which will give me all three broken hypercar Pokemon starter pack. That was a terrible joke. Now, one thing we absolutely have to do is remove the wheels, at least on the back, because when we take the engine out, well, the the engine cradle away from the rest of the car, the wheels have to go somewhere. And I don't have the uh lock tool that we need to get these wheels off. And honestly, I don't think we can get this off anyway. But the brakes back here, I'm not going to say they're okay. But that looks okay to me. You know, I don't need to see anymore. What I'm going to try to do is since the wheel has already been melted and most of the suspension has been melted, I think there's like two bolts I need to take off and the axle will just come right out of the transmission. And then we can just remove this wheel and then figure out what we're going to do for that wheel because I think the wheel might be okay. The suspension's still connected to the car. Uh the the tire has well there are some there are some tolerances in this tire. I don't think this tire is going to hold any air anymore, but that wheel could still be good. It's not good. It's furniture now. Now, if there's anything I can learn from this, it's exactly how different materials handle heat. The wheel and control arms partially melted and became incredibly hard and brittle because they're made of aluminum, which melts at 1,220° F or 660° C. But the carbon fiber on the inner structure stayed intact despite the epoxy gel coating that binds it together being burnt off. And fun fact, carbon fiber doesn't actually melt. It turns directly into a gas, a process called sublimation. and it does so at 6,600° F or 3,700° C. The steel axle also survived because of its higher melting point, but every bushing, dust boot, and anything else made of rubber was basically vaporized. Welcome to the business end of uh well, one of the sides of the 918 Spider. Uh I have taken off a lot of this stuff and it is just coming off in random chunks. This is part of the control arm. That's kind of cool. Another thing that's kind of cool is this. This is the rear wheel steering apparatus motor thing. And you'd think that this would be really, really expensive because it's on a 918 Spider, but actually this is the same unit that's in every 911 from like 2015 on. So, I can find this on eBay for about like $3 $400 used. And uh that way we can save some money because we're going to need to um I thought, hey, maybe the carbon fiber structure, at least in the back, is savable. I don't think so anymore. I mean, look at look at this. It's just it's just garbage. Um there's oil in here. The carbon's coming off. There's no structural like rigidity here. Like some of this stuff is a little bit, you know, still solid, but honestly, I wouldn't feel safe putting anything uh in this, much less an engine. But take a look at this. This is the intake manifold. Uh one side of the intake manifold, and it's made of carbon fiber, but that's that's not supposed to happen. She's a little she's a little crispy. Take a look at this door. It is now uh very bark-l like. And you can actually peel it back and see the layers. Oh boy. That's That's good. That's glass. Look at that. That's all the things you don't want anywhere near your body. Uh I don't know how this door is going to open because the entire mechanism is completely burnt. So maybe we just cut it off. I don't want to cut this off. It feels wrong. feels wrong. We're going to figure it out. What I think I'm going to do is I'm going to put a jack underneath the car. Then we're going to jack the car up. Probably put some dollies underneath it. I don't see any reason why we can't cut this thing in half and remove the engine. I think that's I think we're good. I mean, we'll have to cut some stuff off, but, you know, I feel like we're doing pretty good. I'm going to eat my words. That's uh that was that was that was a terrible thing. That was a terrible thing for me to say.\n",
      " Now, I'll let you in on a little secret. I don't know what I'm doing. But this is super exciting to me because this is one of the coolest cars ever made. And I would never ever have had the opportunity to see one, much less take one apart down to the frame if I didn't do this for a living. So, if you guys like this kind of content, consider subscribing to this channel because I love sharing these crazy car stories and builds with as many people as possible. And if you want to be a supporting member of the channel, you can get perks like seeing videos before they're out to the public, signed memorabilia, and even private tours of my shops and upcoming projects. And everything goes to supporting builds like these. Now, at this point, I felt like I had to be close to taking the rear carbon fiber subframe out, so I undid every coolant and vacuum hose I could see. All right, let's see if there's any coolant left in this car. And Nope. Sweet. I don't know what I was expecting. We got some coolant. Look. Wow. So, there was still some coolant left in this car. So, this is the good side. That's the good side. You may have noticed that this side of the car has a radiator and the other doesn't. And that isn't a weird Porsche design. The other one literally melted. And while I'm thankful it's another part I don't have to take off right now, because it's a hypercar, the assembly costs somewhere north of $10,000. And the body panel it attaches to costs six figures easily. So, I certainly can't afford to break anything on this car that's usable. So, it's crucial that I take my time and be as careful as possible. Now, I think all the bolts are off. We still have a ton of lines connected here, but uh since we're just cutting a bunch of stuff off, I don't think that's going to be a problem. Um I don't know if there's anything else connected. I did not consult any sort of manual or really anything other than the bolt I saw. So, I'm going to take a pry bar to it. No way. No way. Look at this. Look at this. Three, two, one. This is crazy. Can't believe I'm doing this. Oh, look at that. Woo. All right. This is how Porsche does it from the factory. All right. So, there are two bolts holding on a air conditioning line. And I believe when I take these bolts off, the engine should fall out. Hopefully not onto my arm. But it's okay cuz I got another one. And this is the this important one. Listen to that Porsche quality. I'm okay. I think we're good. I think we're good. Let's go. Yeah. Yes. Hell yeah. Woo. Yeah.\n",
      " Oh my. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Woo. Ladies and gentlemen, we are Porsche master techs at this point. We are Porsche certified. Uh we did this in a day. I didn't know I didn't know what I was doing. And look at this. This is a This is a $2 million automobile. And now it is clefted straight into Twain. All right, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to clean up. I'm going to clean up and then uh I'm going to see how how bad this car is. It's probably really bad. So, in all seriousness, this was something that on a regular 918 Spider would have taken the dealership several days to do. The car's bow and stern were no longer touching, and that was exactly what I needed to start the process of bringing it back home to the USA. But I wasn't done inspecting my project car. I still had to find out if the $100,000 hybrid battery was still good after all these years. So, I asked the most well-known and knowledgeable EV expert I knew to help me diagnose it. And when he wasn't available, I brought in Rich Rebuilds. I want to ask you what you think of my my new project, my uh my new my new little hyperar because you like Porsches and you like\n",
      " McLaren's EVs. EVs, they're okay.\n",
      " I've moved on. I probably shouldn't be here. Now, Freddy, I I will say I think\n",
      " this car was way ahead of its time for what it was.\n",
      " 0 to 60 in 2.2 seconds 10 years ago was mind-blowing. Today, it's still crazy.\n",
      " Yeah. So, I think the fact that they were able to do this without turbos, McLaren, I think it's awesome. Awesome feat. I think this is the number one car in the Holy Trinity. I'll die on that hill. Fight beyond it. This is the one I I I love this car more than anything else. I think this looks awesome. I think it's a work of art. I personally think you should don't even touch it. Just put it somewhere and have it displayed as a piece of art. I think this is art just sitting here as it is. So, if this is art,\n",
      " then I should be able to sell it to some rich guy for $30 million as a write-off.\n",
      " Well, but that's how art works.\n",
      " At the same time, didn't some rich guy sell it to you? Listen, man. All right. There's a battery over there. There's a battery. Let's go check out the battery. Hi. We have uh a bunch of screws to take off and a bunch of screws up here at the top. And uh Rich is just looking at me like he's not a part of this.\n",
      " Yes. Unfortunately, I don't have my uh correct linesman gloves on. These are a little bit thinner. They actually took the gloves at customs.\n",
      " They took my gloves at customs. Can you believe that? They took your gloves at\n",
      " They took my gloves at customs. They said nope. I don't know why.\n",
      " We're going to We're going to pretend like that's believable. So, uh let's\n",
      " You ever seen two men get electrocuted?\n",
      " Dude, we're going to be just fine. Like I said, this there's a lot of dangers on this. This one's in German. There's only there's only two dangers on it. I think uh you want to do your side.\n",
      " It says high voltage I'm reading this upside down. High voltage can cause what what is it? Burns serious and and death. Death\n",
      " and death. Yeah, it said it can.\n",
      " It can, but not not that it will. It could.\n",
      " Yeah, I do like that. Yeah, it's it's a little bit\n",
      " it leaves it leaves a little bit to the imagination.\n",
      " The things that we were doing to the P1 battery were just unspeakable. I know that some of McLaren was just like, what are these fools doing?\n",
      " Well, here's the thing. Uh, the thing that that that Hurricane did to that P1 was also unspeakable. So, I feel like I feel like what we did was just making it better.\n",
      " That was nothing. Yeah.\n",
      " Yeah. This may actually get me a cease and desist from Porsche.\n",
      " I think Porsche would actually like you doing this.\n",
      " I feel like Porsche is not going to like me doing this. Oh, wa. Look at that. Dude, that's so cool. There it is. That is dope. That looks brand new. There's nothing wrong with that. Literally looks brand new.\n",
      " That literally looks like it just came out of the factory. I'm not touching it. You are 100% right, man. Do not touch this thing.\n",
      " You know what? I still think you should ditch the hybrid system and make it um\n",
      " I So, dial 91. And on my mark,\n",
      " dial one again. What I'm going to do now,\n",
      " okay, that's where I'm going to put the multimeter and see if there's any juice on it.\n",
      " So, for anybody that is new to any of this, this is a high voltage battery,\n",
      " right? Um, it has been discharged for the better part of I mean more than a decade at this point. But you always, always, always want to treat these things\n",
      " like it's\n",
      " as if it's live. Uh, sort of like a firearm. You want always, it doesn't matter if it has uh bullets in it or not. You always want to treat it like the gun is always loaded. What in the heck? Okay. Got nothing there.\n",
      " Wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no. It did something. Yeah. Wait, what?\n",
      " 270.\n",
      " Holy\n",
      " There's something in it for sure. Yep. That's That was\n",
      " Oh, for sure. 270 volts.\n",
      " Now, this is the rich rebuilds. I know.\n",
      " This is the I know. Once you start spreading them,\n",
      " where's your uh butter knife? We're about to take a Tesla apart.\n",
      " With a battery fully charged, you would expect to see around 408 volts, but Rich's readings were very inconsistent and weren't reading anything except for tiny blips when the voltage would spike and then come back down again. And I'll also post the full extended cut of what we found on my second channel. What was becoming clear to me at that moment was that I'd have to get a new battery despite the internals of this one being flawless. But then Rich had another idea. So, for the heck of it, I decided um\n",
      " what was my decision? But someone suggested use a different multimeter. And I said multimeters are always right. Well, guess what? 370.\n",
      " 370 volts.\n",
      " Yeah. That is nearly fully charged. Also, that's a bomb. That's like literally I'm just It was It was bizarre that I wasn't getting any readings before, but it's saying 370.\n",
      " 370 volts.\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      " Okay. So, this battery is good.\n",
      " The exciting part is that I no longer have to deal with this thing. It's not coming to me.\n",
      " It absolutely is coming to you. It absolutely is coming. Okay. So, basically, I have to now rebuild the car and then put that in and then hopefully everything works and doesn't burn to the ground. Awesome. Godspeed.\n",
      " The hybrid battery still being alive after all these years was another massive win. So, I felt like I had nothing to lose by taking apart the 918's aluminum rear bulkhead to see what was underneath. And after removing all the bolts, hoses, and whatever was left of the wiring, I found the fuel tank in surprisingly untouched condition. I removed the only two bolts holding the fuel tank straps in, disconnected the lines on the top, and then the fuel tank, which was still very full of what was certainly 10-year-old varnish, could slide right out of the back of the carbon tub. And since I wanted the tub to be 100% soot free, I took off the melted leather trim and petrified urethane, which used to hold the rear center glass in. I went over everything with a wire brush and then decided that I should get the chassis in the air to clean underneath, which proved a bit difficult. I could see it doing it already.\n",
      " Yeah, it's already\n",
      " Yeah, it's already lifting off.\n",
      " Look at that. Yep. Oh, yeah.\n",
      " Oh, back down. This is going to be real loud. Yep. 3 2 1. Oh. Oh no. You got to use power to loosen that one. Let's see how well balanced this is. Okay. Wow. Look at all that tread. Can I see that for a second? Editor, please keep this part in. Keep this part of the video in. Look at that. It came like that. Got to do the shake test. It's not going anywhere. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the underside of a Porsche 918 Spider. Where are you going, Rich?\n",
      " Oh, I was hoping I'd just leave. That's all. Welcome to the underside of a Porsche 9118 Spider. And uh honestly, this looks really, really good. Doesn't even look like it has been on fire at all. Not even a little bit. Everything here is carbon fiber. And you can see like there's there's a little air gap in here cuz the air kind of goes in here and then down there. And if you notice, this is not like a flat floor. It actually does like a little bit of a hump because there needs to be an air gap for I'm I'm guessing this uh you can see that there's like standoffs here. I'm getting really geeky. There's a uh flat floor that uh attaches to here and it gives a little bit of like an inch of air gap. I'm sure that there's a reason for that. I'm not going to demonstrate that reason cuz I don't know. But uh what do you what do you think about this?\n",
      " I think it's air flow for the electric motor for sure.\n",
      " Air flow for the electric motor. Yeah, cuz I don't really see how it's cooled. I'm sure it's cooled in some way, but\n",
      " Oh, it's definitely cool.\n",
      " This is kind of interesting, though. This residue right here. What do you think that is? Think it's a coffee stain?\n",
      " That is a coffee stain. Yeah. This This car has been drinking coffee. These giant carbon ceramic rotors. Look at this. Look at that. It's like a It's like a mirror. It's like a mirror.\n",
      " It's like a personal pizza.\n",
      " It's like a personal That's a big That's a big personal pizza.\n",
      " Yeah, it's a big person. Any pizza can be a personal pizza if you try hard enough.\n",
      " That's right.\n",
      " We can see that what looks like a transmission or a um like a transfer case or something. This is actually the AC compressor. Uh the AC compressor is a electronic unit and it lives right here in the middle of the car. Then coming down here, this is where the battery would be but the battery was taken out. I don't know where the battery is. I'm sure the battery is very very expensive. The lithium batteries, what do they go for? Like something\n",
      " big money. I mean, for for McLaren, it's what? Three grand for lithium battery.\n",
      " Yeah. So, this is probably three grand plus three grand plus three grand. So, yeah. This is where it goes. There's a positive and there's a negative here. And back here, the thing that's attached with zip ties from the factory. That's kind of weird. Uh, that looks like it is an air compressor. So, that means our car has front lift.\n",
      " Front axle lift.\n",
      " Front axle lift. It's air instead of hydraulic like the McLaren. The McLaren takes like nine business days to rise.\n",
      " It does.\n",
      " This one, I'm sure, is a lot faster.\n",
      " It does. It does take 6 to 8 weeks to have the front lift work. But, um, coming back here, all the carbon fiber totally fine. This is where the battery lives. And there is no sign of damage at all. Um, and the only sign of damage is when you come out here and this is a bit singed and then you get, you know, a little worse for wear. I think this is fixable, dude. I think there's nothing. There's nothing in here. There's nothing over there. Well, there's a little bit over there, but honestly, I think wiring harness like and some cleanup work and then get a new one of whatever that is. And this car is ready to go. I feel I feel like\n",
      " Yes,\n",
      " I know. You know what I'm thinking?\n",
      " No,\n",
      " you don't know what I'm thinking.\n",
      " Nope. I think we should put 12 volts to here and then see what happens.\n",
      " I would put 12 volts to the official jump post in the car.\n",
      " Fine. Okay. All right.\n",
      " We'll do it your way.\n",
      " Oh, no, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine. Let's do Well, I was going to crawl under here and, you know, energize it. Uh, so we need to clean up some of the wiring up top just to make sure that we don't have a massive\n",
      " a lot of uh I think there's a lot of copper strands that are just pretty much tied together at this point cuz when the fire burned everything,\n",
      " it just wound all the wires together. So, we're going to cut those back so we can see what we're doing. Uh, anything that's kind of a melted plastic we could get rid of. Do you want to go through the fuses as well or you just want to send it?\n",
      " Uh, I'll send it and then if we need to replace fuses, we will.\n",
      " Okay. I think this is going to be fine. I think it's going to be pretty upset. And look for the rear end of the car.\n",
      " It's It's going to be It's Where are my legs? I can't feel my legs.\n",
      " Father, father, give me legs.\n",
      " It's so cold.\n",
      " Yeah. Right. So So yeah, I think I think we should do that. And I What's the over under and you think the display turning on?\n",
      " On display turning on?\n",
      " Yeah. 35%.\n",
      " Really?\n",
      " 35%.\n",
      " What would make it 50%. If you help me. Now, here is the moment of truth. Almost. Uh, I have the key. Look at the key. Look at this thing. It's just like a regular\n",
      " It's like every other Porsche key.\n",
      " It's every other Porsche key, but this has been sitting for 10 years. Check this out. Still has battery.\n",
      " I don't think that's the first time you've pressed that. I don't believe you. It's not. I I I never said it was a first time. I just I knew that.\n",
      " You're You're building up the drama like, \"Oh my gosh, is it going to turn on?\"\n",
      " I'm sorry if I have to be entertaining. We are going to put 12 volts to this guy right here. That is the battery post. And uh there are probably 10,000 fuses that are just blown or something. And uh Porsche has given us these extra fuses that's that just comes with the car. Draxel Meyers. What's this called? I don't like the fact that this is named Eliminator one bit.\n",
      " Yeah. I feel like\n",
      " that's that's not a good name.\n",
      " I feel like I feel like little helper, you know?\n",
      " Right. Little buddy.\n",
      " So, what happens if uh we have Well, it's not going to be electrical fire. If it is electrical fire, we just take the electricity out.\n",
      " Yeah. We just we just undo it. We just start running. You want to do the honors?\n",
      " No.\n",
      " All right. Something's going on. Something happens. Oh. Oh my. Look.\n",
      " You okay? Yes.\n",
      " I can't see anything. I'm under\n",
      " Yes. number 104. I'm under the hood. I can't.\n",
      " It says number 104. Dude, it it There's life in this car. If I do this Oh.\n",
      " Oh, it sure. What if I Oh, no way. No way.\n",
      " Started. Started driving,\n",
      " dude. I can't. Look at this.\n",
      " Dude, this is going to be easy one.\n",
      " This is so No way. You got to be kidding me.\n",
      " There's music. Actually, this this says this says 2,700 km.\n",
      " Someone lied to you.\n",
      " Someone lied. Someone lied to you.\n",
      " This says 2,700 K 2701. This This doesn't seem to work. No, this doesn't work. Lights work. Yep. Oh, that there's one. Yeah, one works. I cannot believe that we Bro. Bro, half this car is over here and it was burned and we are This is so crazy. This is so crazy. And it there's not even a little bit of electrical fire. All right. I feel like that is the biggest win that I could ask for. Huge win personally, man. I think it\n",
      " this is awesome.\n",
      " This is so amazing. I think this rebuild is going to be super easy. I Why did I say that? I'm not Yeah. Yeah. Stop. Stop it. Stop it. I turned it off. Did Can it eliminate itself? So, we do that and we do that, right? The eliminator never shuts off.\n",
      " Cool. It'll turn back on in a second. I think it just shut off. Well, you just So, we have battery good, but you're going to still look at it. Okay.\n",
      " Um, and see if you can charge it and what the cells are made of and stuff.\n",
      " And we know electrical system, at least in this front half of the car, good.\n",
      " Engine, possibly.\n",
      " It's definitely good. It's absolutely good.\n",
      " Poss. Well, we don't we don't know cuz I I love Okay, let's be to Okay, let's let's be real. Think about this logically. Was the car running?\n",
      " No. So, what's the issue?\n",
      " Like, how how I mean, what's what's the problem? Nothing was running.\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      " Right. And there was some fire on the top. The the coil packs didn't melt or anything.\n",
      " No.\n",
      " I think it should be good, man.\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      " Oh, the car does have 2,000 kilometers on it.\n",
      " Yeah, it's high mileage.\n",
      " It's I I'm surprised knowing that I would have offered less. Can you go back and say, \"Hey, this isn't You need to\n",
      " I feel like I feel like I should get half off.\" Huh? Half off. Get it? Half off.\n",
      " Yeah. Get it.\n",
      " Get it.\n",
      " With the long weekend nearly over, I had to give the shop back to the guys at Vibrant. And that meant I had to put the chassis, the engine, the wheels, and every broken part I took off my 918 on pallets so it could be picked up and shipped across the border. And if any of you are wondering, cars made for the Canadian market, like this one, also need to abide by US safety and emission standards. So, the usual 25-year-old import rule does not apply like it would on something made for the European or Japanese markets. And with the pallets loaded up, strapped down, and wrapped better than any Christmas present I can imagine, my 918 Spider was finally ready to head to its new home. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the culmination of all our work. The car is clefted in twain. It is uh the back half is off of it. It is on a pallet and now it is ready to hit the states hopefully. I actually don't know what's going to happen. I don't know if they're going to stop this at customs. And uh Rich is What do you Where you going? What's up? Hi. Come on, man.\n",
      " Hi. So Rich has been instrumental in all of this. He's been helping out and uh we've both been burning the midnight oil and uh and making very very very inappropriate jokes off camera. So, absolutely. Yeah. Um now, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the guys at Vibrant and Bruno at Vibrant. Uh\n",
      " here you go. No, Bruno has let me let me be very very honest with you. He's treated me like family. Um everybody here at Vibrant has treated me like family and uh I I love I mean I'd love to work with you guys. This is this is an amazing shop. Uh, and you guys have an amazing uh, set of people here and really they're all car people. They love cars. Uh, so I'll put the link in the video description below. Um, but they have the best products. They like you, you guys have no idea, no idea the stuff that we have brewing up.\n",
      " It's been fun. It's been an amazing last couple of days. It just started something up and it's been wonderful having you guys here.\n",
      " Uh, hopefully you guys come back with a car that's a little bit more put together than this one\n",
      " or maybe this one. We never know.\n",
      " Listen, man. I I don't I I don't know. So, I have to go say something nice about me. He's very nice.\n",
      " You have this guy.\n",
      " I I really like your hair.\n",
      " Thank you. Okay. Uh go go go check out Rich's channel. Uh it's Rich Rebuilds. Um Rich Rich actually he um he went um he went to Harvard and he also been on Joe Rogan twice.\n",
      " He's been on Joe Rogan twice.\n",
      " Uh I've been on Joe Rogan zero times. Um, but uh, no, Rich is has the most amazing channel when it comes to EVs swaps and uh, I mean, not even EVs. You have you have a Hellcat minivan. I don't have a Hellcat minivan.\n",
      " That was your idea. Right stole it.\n",
      " Yeah, he stole my idea, but it's okay because you can steal people's ideas. It's It's fine. Um, we're a little loopy here, but in the next video on this car, hopefully hopefully hopefully this is going to be in the States and in my shop. So, I can't wait for that. and I can't wait to get started on my 918 Spider. I can't believe I'm saying that. All right, see you guys later. Heat. Heat.\n"

But despite the 918 Spider having the least power and most weight of the three cars on paper, it could go from 0 to 60 mph in 2.2 2 seconds, nearly half a second faster than the other two cars, thanks to its nearly 900 horsepower hybrid electric drivetrain and all-wheel drive.

I sprayed some of the very small bolts with rust penetrint, then removed the 918's titanium heat shielding and settled in so I can really see the mess going on at the back. Oh my goodness. This is the business end of the hybrid system. I think this was the ECU, the engine computer, and everything is melted. So, this is it's all strands of carbon fiber. Look how they just come apart.
